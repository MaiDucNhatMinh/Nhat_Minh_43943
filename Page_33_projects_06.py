Problem:     Write and test a program that computes the area of a circle. This program should
request a number representing a radius as input from the user. It should use the formula
3.14 * radius ** 2 to compute the area and then output this result suitably labeled.
Solution:
    ....
"""
radius = float(input("Enter with radius: "))
print("Circumference = " + str(3.14 * radius ** 2))
