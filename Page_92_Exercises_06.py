Problem:    What happens when the programmer forgets to update the loop control variable in
a while loop?
Solution:
    Loop Control Variable - it specifies how many times, the loop will be running based on the condition.
    Condition is false, in the first iteration itself, control will be out of the while loop and execute the statements
after the while loop.
